# Riftfound

A calendar view for Riftbound TCG events.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev servers (SQLite mode, no geocoding)
./dev.sh

# Or with PostgreSQL + Photon geocoder
./dev.sh --docker --photon
```

Frontend: http://localhost:5173

## Development

### dev.sh Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| (none) | SQLite mode, no Docker, no geocoding |
| `--docker` | Start PostgreSQL via docker-compose |
| `--postgres` | Use PostgreSQL for app (implies --docker) |
| `--photon` | Start Photon geocoder (first run downloads ~8GB) |
| `--keep-docker` | Keep Docker services running on exit |
| `--reset` | Delete all data (DB + Docker volumes) |
| `--reset-db` | Delete DB only (preserve Photon data) |

### Manual Commands

```bash
npm run dev:backend   # Start backend only
npm run dev:frontend  # Start frontend only
npm run dev:scraper   # Run scraper once
npm test              # Run all tests (Vitest)
```

## API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/events` | List events with filtering |
| `GET /api/events/:id` | Single event |
| `GET /api/events/info` | Scrape stats |
| `GET /api/events/geocode?q=` | Geocode location |

### Query Parameters

- `page`, `limit` - Pagination
- `search` - Text search
- `city`, `state`, `country` - Location filters
- `eventType` - Event type filter (Summoner Skirmish, Nexus Night)
- `lat`, `lng`, `radiusKm` - Distance filtering
- `calendarMode=true` - Return all events in 3-month range

## Architecture

- **Database**: SQLite for dev, DynamoDB for production. Controlled by `DB_TYPE` env var.
- **Geocoding**: Mapbox API (primary) with self-hosted Photon (OSM-based) as fallback for dev.
- **Shops table**: Geocoded store locations, events reference via `shop_id`
- **Scraper**: Runs every 60min cycle, fetches all ~30k events with requests distributed evenly across the cycle to avoid rate limiting
- **Event sources**: Two, merged and de-duplicated by location + start time:
  - UVS Games store locator API (one global query, paginated across the cycle)
  - Riot's official playriftbound API, which adds authoritative event types and
    registration links. It clamps every search to a ~161km radius around a
    coordinate, so there is no global query - the scraper sweeps anchors seeded
    from known event locations, a rotating batch per run at ~1 request/second.
    See [scraper/CLAUDE.md](scraper/CLAUDE.md).

## Deployment

Production runs on AWS serverless with Terraform:

- **Frontend**: S3 + CloudFront (HTTPS)
- **Backend API**: Lambda + API Gateway (via CloudFront)
- **Scraper**: Lambda + EventBridge (hourly)
- **Database**: DynamoDB

### Deploy Commands

```bash
# First time setup
cp deploy.env.example deploy.env
# Edit deploy.env with your AWS values

# Deploy
./deploy.sh frontend        # React app to S3/CloudFront
./deploy.sh backend-lambda  # Backend API to Lambda
./deploy.sh scraper-lambda  # Scraper to Lambda
./deploy.sh lambdas         # Both backend and scraper to Lambda
```
